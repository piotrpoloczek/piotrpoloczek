## About me

Mechatronics / software engineer with **5+ years of experience** in **medical device R&D**.   I lead a Mechanical Design Department and deliver **end-to-end product development** (CAD → prototyping → documentation) with strong **software/embedded integration**.   I enjoy building systems where **mechanics, electronics, and software** work together — from concept to validated prototype and production-ready design.

---

## What I do

- Medical device development: **concept → prototype → production documentation**
- Cross-functional coordination: **mechanics + electronics + software**
- Integration work: actuators, sensors, wiring, enclosures, serviceability
- Embedded + software support: turning mechanical constraints into **clear integration requirements**

## Selected projects

## Selected projects

### Multisensory Therapy Table (medical device)
- Multisensory rehabilitation device combining **upper-limb motor therapy** with **cognitive training** (attention, memory, problem-solving)  
- Supports **personalized therapy** based on test results and progress, daily-activity attachments, optional **VR/biofeedback**, and integration with therapist database/other rehab devices

### Pediatric Exoskeleton (concept / prototype)
- Concept development with focus on ergonomics, safety, adjustability  
- Prepared design for future sensor/actuator integration and control system constraints
